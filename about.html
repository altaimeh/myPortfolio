    <h2>About me...</h2>
    <div class="about">
        <h3>Ever since I was a little kid, computers have been my passion. I still remember the excitement I felt when I saw and was able 
            to play some video games on a desktop for the first time. As I interacted with the machine, it felt like it was almost magic, 
            being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted, just by typing in these funny little symbols, limited only by my own 
            imagination. Throughout high school, I tried to learn as much as I could by joining different clubs and participated in 
            Hackathons to learn anything related to coding. I wanted to keep going. This passion drove me to pursue higher education at 
            the University of Michigan. Here there are more resources available to me than I ever could have imagined as a kid. I am 
            currently learning new algorithms, frameworks, higher mathematics, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as 
            a kid. It is here that I learned truly how much there was yet to learn. I want to keep this passion with me going into the 
            industry. There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very 
            grateful. </h3>
